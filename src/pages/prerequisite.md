# Prerequisite

Before going through the process to install all the necessary components to start doing machine learning or deep learning stuff on your Windows operating system, we need to ensure that some prerequisites are met properly. 

Here, we will go through all the necessary steps that must be ensured and therefore are considered as pre-requisite.

### Windows Version

Make sure that you have the latest version of Windows operating system installed (Windows 11). Also, make sure that you are using the Pro version of Windows 11. I am not sure whether the same process would work on the other versions (Home, etc.). 

But if you are someone who is trying to follow this project in your Windows11 operating system having different Windows11 version (Home, etc.), then please let me know whether it is working on your case in a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FahimFBA/WinML/issues).

### Windows Activation

We need to ensure that our Windows operating system is properly activated. It is necessary as according to Microsoft, certain features or settings might be unavailable to you until you activate your Windows operating system. I do not support piracy in any way, and therefore, I can not talk about any pirated stuff at all. I hope you would understand that.


#### Check Windows Activation Status

Simply open the Windows settings. Then go to System. Find **Activation** in the System tab. Finally, open the Activation tab. If your Windows operating system is already activated, then you will see that the Activation state is marked as "Active" like below example.

### Windows Update

Make sure that you have installed all the updates properly. Click on "Check for updates" from the **Windows Update** tab in the Settings. Make sure that all necessary updates are installed successfully.

Make sure that it says "You're up to date" like the image below.
